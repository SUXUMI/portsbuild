# portsbuild


## Introduction
PortsBuild is an alternative to [DirectAdmin](http://www.directadmin.com)'s [CustomBuild](http://forum.directadmin.com/showthread.php?t=44743) for [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) installations using [Ports](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-overview.html) (and Packages) to improve the relationship between two fantastic systems.

Automation and Integration is achieved by using simple shell scripts, along with recommended practices according to the FreeBSD Handbook.  PortsBuild will use a combination of ports (using portmaster), packages (via pkg) and a slew of port option knobs (injected into /etc/make.conf) to install the necessary services on a FreeBSD system.

The source code for this project will be open source. A distribution & copyright license has not been chosen yet at this time.

* PigeonHole
* Mailman
* SpamBlocker 4.3.x integration by NoBaloney
* proftpd
* MariaDB 10


Phase 3
* AwStats
* Webalizer


Phase 4 (no ports found / research req. / untested)
* ZendOptimizer (unknown)
* ZendOpCache (works on 8.3-amd64) or php56-opcache?
