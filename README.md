# portsbuild


## Introduction
PortsBuild is an alternative to [DirectAdmin](http://www.directadmin.com)'s [CustomBuild](http://forum.directadmin.com/showthread.php?t=44743) for [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) installations using [Ports](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-overview.html) (and Packages) to improve the relationship between two fantastic systems.

Automation and integration is achieved by using simple shell scripts, along with the recommended practices of managing a FreeBSD system according to the [FreeBSD Handbook](https://www.freebsd.org/handbook). PortsBuild will use a combination of ports (using [synth](https://github.com/jrmarino/synth) and portmaster) and packages (via pkg) while configuration options are maintained in either /etc/make.conf or /var/db/ports/*/options to install the necessary services on a FreeBSD system.

The source code for this project will be open source. A distribution & copyright license has not been chosen yet at this time.

PortsBuild will NOT support:
* SquirrelMail - last release in 2011, however a fork exists in CB2 (1.4.22-20140402_0200)
* ZendOptimizer - unsupported on FreeBSD
* mod_ruid2 - unsupported on FreeBSD


### Currently known issues and limitations
* BIND (named) does not restart after adding a domain on 9.3 due to startup script location in /etc/rc.d/ instead of /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ (DirectAdmin limitation)
* PHP-FPM does not restart after adding a user due to startup script being called "php-fpm" instead of "php-fpmXX" (XX= 55, 56, 70, etc.) (DirectAdmin limitation)
* Only one instance of PHP can be installed through ports/packages (afaik). Multiple PHP versions may be possible, but requires testing.

### Changes from DA/CB defaults
* PHP Sockets are now found under /var/run/php/sockets (used to be: /usr/local/php%VER%/sockets)
* The WWW directory is now /usr/local/www (used to be: /var/www/html)

### Additional documentation to add
* Virtualization (FreeBSD+DA as a Guest VM)
* IPFW / Firewall integration scripts
* Performance tweaks & tunes


## Future Plans
* Poudriere package building system integration (and hosting too)
* CustomBuild to PortsBuild conversion guide
* DirectAdmin UI Plugin for PortsBuild similarly to [CustomBuild's plugin](http://forum.directadmin.com/showthread.php?t=48989)
* Failover (CARP+HAST) configurations
* Load-Balancing between multiple servers
* Best Practices Guide (Infrastructure, Design, Implementation, Maintenance, Security, Updates, Upgrades)
* Additional solutions and topics: pfSense, ZFS, ESXi, performance & networking tuning
