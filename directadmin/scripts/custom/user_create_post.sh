## PB: Restart services after adding a user
## (DA can't do these for us right now due to control script filename differences)

## note to self: perhaps add a "sleep 10" here to give DA enough time to do its thing
## also add checks to see if php-fpm/apache24 is actually installed (same for nginx)
/sbin/service php-fpm reload
/sbin/service apache24 graceful
/sbin/service named reload

exit 0;
